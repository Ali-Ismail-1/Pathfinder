This is an exercise to bring DSA into a real life application. This contrasts theoretical problems that live on leetcode and instead have some practicality. The adult brain learns more effectively when the material is relevant and applicable. I'm using this game as an exercise to do just that.

This is a maze solving game where users can generate a random maze and guide themselves to find the shortest path from start to finish.

## DSA Concepts

Recursive Backgracking: Generate random mazes
BFS: Find the shortest path in the maze
DFS: Explore all paths

## Features

Random maze is generated
Visualizes the pathfinding of an algorithm
